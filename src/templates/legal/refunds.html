        <h1 class="text-2xl"><strong>Soundbits Refund Policy </strong></h1>
        <p class=""><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 01, 2024</p>
        <p class="mt-5">At Fynmost SRL, we are committed to providing
            a fair and transparent billing process for our subscription service, which charges based on your
            actual usage (&quot;Usage-Based Billing&quot;). This refund policy outlines the conditions under which
            refunds may be issued.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl mt-5"><strong>1. Eligibility for Refunds</strong></h2>
        <p class="">Due to the nature of usage-based billing, refunds are
            generally not provided for charges that accurately reflect the services consumed. However, you may be
            eligible for a refund under the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted-list">
            <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Billing Errors:</strong> If you believe that you have been
                incorrectly charged due to a billing error, you may request a refund for the erroneous amount.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="bulleted-list">
            <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Service Outages:</strong> If you experience a prolonged service
                outage or significant disruption that is verifiable and due to our fault, you may be eligible for a
                partial refund or credit based on the impact of the outage on your usage.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="bulleted-list">
            <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Unauthorized Charges:</strong> If there are unauthorized
                charges on your account, you must report them within 30 days of the
                charge to be eligible for a refund.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="bulleted-list">
            <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Refund Approval:</strong> If your refund request is approved,
                the refund amount will be calculated based on the specific circumstances (e.g., proportionate to the
                service outage duration, correcting the billing error).</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="bulleted-list">
            <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Refund Method:</strong> Approved refunds will be issued to the
                original payment method used during the billing cycle. Please allow 5-15
                business days for the refund to appear on your statement.</li>

        <ul class="bulleted-list">
            <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Usage Disputes:</strong> Disputes over charges that accurately

        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-xl mt-5"><strong>5. Adjustments and Credits</strong></h2>
        <p class="">In certain cases, instead of a refund, we may issue an
            account credit that can be applied to future usage. This may occur if the refund request is related to a
            minor billing error or as an alternative to a refund in other circumstances.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl mt-5"><strong>6. Changes to This Policy</strong></h2>
        <p class="">We may update this refund policy from time to time. If
            we make significant changes, we will notify you through the Service or by email. Your continued use of
            the Service after the changes take effect constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
